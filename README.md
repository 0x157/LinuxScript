# About
Personal Linux Script That Automates Installation For Tools and Python3 Modules.

The script itself installs popular `cybersecurity` tools like nmap, ncat, medusa, john, hashcat and proxychains4.

Same goes for python3 modules that I tend to use daily and alot in general: bs4, requests, rich, scapy, pyarmor, cryptography, and python-nmap

# Usage

The only REQUIRNMENT is to have python3 installed and in most cases newer linux systems come pre-installed with it, you do have to run the script with
sudo priveledges as it navigates throught directories and some subprocess commands do require `root` priveledges.

Anyone Can Use the Script, I will try to maintain it as much as possible.
